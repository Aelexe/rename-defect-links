# rename-defect-links
A tiny Outlook VBScript to make defect hyperlinks more aesthetically pleasing.

Despite its simplicity this snippet of code has saved me ample time writing emails in the past few years.

It also wins the award for being the only VBScript I will ever write, as I never want to touch it again.
